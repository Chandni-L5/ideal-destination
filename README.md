## 2. Design 
### 2.2 Imagery
The colour scheme chosen to apply to this project has been determined on the background image. The ai image has been sourced through [chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com/). A request for an image of an airplane in the bright blue sky with clouds was entered and various images were provided. I selected the chose background as it was a clear and uncluttered image, the colours used are uniform and it was suitable to be used as a background. 

The opacity of the image was altered using [befunky.com](https://www.befunky.com/dashboard/). 

The ai images used on the results pages have also been sourced from [chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com/). The images are based on three themes; 
general, accommodation and activity. I have entered a variety of descriptions into the search box and chosen the most appealing images.

### 2.3 Colour Scheme
![Colour palette of the colours applied](/documentation/color-palette.webp)

The colour scheme applied has been selected based on the tones of the background image. In order the standout against the blue tones the darker colours have a green/blue hue. The opacity of the white sections which contain text has been altered to overlay over the background without creating a harsh delineation.
