## 1. User Experience

The purpose of this website is to provide a fun and interactive quiz that helps the user determine their ideal travel destination based on their preferences. Based on the responses, it suggests a destination, type of accommodation and exciting activity.

The site is aimed at users of all ages for a fun experience to help identify a perfect vacation scenario based on popular holiday destinations.

### 1.1 User Stories

#### Client Goals
- To be able to view the site on a range of devices.
- An easy-to-use format to proceed through the quiz.
- Ability to clearly identify which option you have clicked on, and change selection before moving to the next question

#### Returning Client Goals
- Bright and engaging imagery without compromising visibility of the written content.
- Ability to restart the quiz
- Ability to feedback on future destination suggestions

I have utilized the Projects function on my repository to keep track of the user stories that apply to this site. The user stories are recorded along with the acceptance criteria and tasks required to meet this goal. The stories are organized into sections of progress and allow me to keep track of where I am at throughout the development process.

## 2. Design

### 2.1 Imagery

The colour scheme chosen to apply to this project has been determined on the background image. The ai image has been sourced through [chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com/). A request for an image of an airplane in the bright blue sky with clouds was entered and various images were provided. I selected the chose background as it was a clear and uncluttered image, the colours used are uniform and it was suitable to be used as a background.

The opacity of the image was altered using [befunky.com](https://www.befunky.com/dashboard/).

The ai images used on the results pages have also been sourced from [chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com/). The images are based on three themes;
general, accommodation and activity. I have entered a variety of descriptions into the search box and chosen the most appealing images.

### 2.2 Colour Scheme

![Colour palette of the colours applied](/documentation/color-palette.webp)

The colour scheme applied has been selected based on the tones of the background image. In order the standout against the blue tones the darker colours have a green/blue hue. The opacity of the white sections which contain text has been altered to overlay over the background without creating a harsh delineation.

### 2.3 Wireframes

I used Balsamiq to create wireframes to help me visualize the layout of the site. Wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop were created.

## 3. Features

The website consists of four different pages. The main page contains the introduction and quiz section. Once the finish button is selected at the end of the quiz the user is navigated to another page based on their results of the selections made when completing the quiz.

When the index page initially loads, only the page heading, a section contain an introductory message and a start button are displayed.

![Screenshot of the intro message](/documentation/intro-screenshot.webp)

Once the start button is selected, the intro section is hidden and a new section is displayed which is the main quiz section. The first question is displayed with three selectable options displayed below. In addition there is another button which allows the user to move the the next question. The next button is disabled until an option is selected. When the user hovers over or tries to select the next button a tooltip pops up to feedback to the user that an option must be selected first. In addition the cursor displays a no entry symbol. When an option is selected the next button becomes active and no longer displays a tooltip. In addition the cursor becomes a pointer to indicate the button is active.

![image of the tooltip alert when the next button is disabled](/documentation/alert-tooltip.webp)
![GIF of the hover effect](/documentation/hover.gif)

Additional feedback is provided to the user by the interactivity on the quiz section. When the options are hovered over there is an effect and once an option is selected this effect is applied to allow the selection to standout from the other options.

Once you reach the final question the 'Next Question' button changes to the 'Finish' button.

![Screenshot of the first question and options](/documentation/quizbox-screenshot.webp) ![Screenshot of the last Question with Finish Button](/documentation/finishbutton.webp)

After the last question is answered and 'Finish' is selected, the user is navigated to a different html page which contains the result of the quiz. The Javascript in the background calculates which option has been selected most frequently to provide a result. In the event of a tie the result is randomized between the two most popular options selected.

An additional effect is applied once the result page is loaded to celebrate the result. The confetti function has been customized to throw out themed emoji's based on the winning destination.

![gif of barbados.html](/documentation/barbados-gif.gif)

All of the pages other than that primary introductory section contain a restart button which navigate back to the very start.

## 6. Testing

### 6.1 Testing User Stories

#### Client Goals
##### Goal: To be able to view the site on a range of devices.
Result- ✔ - The site is responsive on a number of browsers and devices.
##### Goal: An easy-to-use format to proceed through the quiz.
Result- ✔ - simple and clear format of how to step through each section and complete the quiz.
##### Goal: Ability to clearly identify which option you have clicked on, and change selection before moving to the next question
Result- ✔ - the selected option is highlighted and the option even expands subtly to clearly showcase the selection. The user also has the ability to change their selection before moving the the next question. 

#### Returning Client Goals
##### Goal: Bright and engaging imagery without compromising visibility of the written content.
Result- ✔ - The site includes relevant images, following a similar colour theme and is bright and engaging. 

##### Goal: Ability to restart the quiz 
Result- ✔ - A clear and obvious restart button is visible throughout the quiz and also on the final result page which navigates the user back to the start. 

##### Goal: Ability to feedback on future destination suggestions
Result- ✘ - Due to time constraints I was unable to include a feedback function however on future implementations this is something that I would consider to include.

### 6.2 Accessibility
During the designing and styling process of the website, I have kept in mind to aim to make the page as user friendly and accessible as possible. I have achieved this by:

Semantic HTML -Use of descriptive alt attributes on the images used throughout the site. -I have checked the colour scheme used on the page using [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to check the colour contrast.

I have also used the chrome extension Web Disability Simulator to also consider the visuals of the page and contrast between the content for users with visual impairments.

A google font has been used on the site however I have also applied Sans-Serif as a font alternative.

Finally, as displayed in the Lighthouse testing in section 6.5 below, the scores of accessibility are at 100% on all pages of the site.

### 6.3 Fixing Bugs

### 6.4 Manual Testing
Full testing has been completed on the following devices: 
* Laptop: Macbook Air M3 2024
* Mobile: Iphone 15

The browsers used to test the site include: 
* Google Chrome
* Safari
* Mozilla Firefox

![table showing manual testing](/documentation/manual-testing.png)

All of the manual testing yielded a positive result. During the development process, manual testing was ongoing, especially whilst building the JavaScript code as it was essential to ensure the functions being applied were working correctly and as expected. Chrome dev tools was used in this process, particularly the Console tool to identify any errors that were occurring in JavaScript and also using the AI assistance to identify how to resolve the issue.

The site was also tested by numerous friends and family members who confirmed that the site was functioning as expected and they had a positive experience. 

### 6.5 Lighthouse

Please select this [link](lighthouse.md) to view screenshots of the lighthouse analysis.

The main issues identified across the site were in relation to the speed at which the page and content loads and issues with cumulative layout shifts and image sizing. I implemented some changes by preloading some of the external content as the page loads and adding a height to the `<img>` tag in CSS.

On checking the site through lighthouse after the changes were made, this improved the scores greatly.

### 6.6 Validation

#### 6.6.1 W3C HTML and CSS

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) validator has been used to check the HTML on each of the pages of the website and the css stylesheet.

##### HTML - [index.html](index.html)

![screenshot of html validator results for the index page](/documentation/html-val-index.webp)

The initial check highlighted a few issues with the code. These issues have now been addressed and all of the html code on the homepage has successfully passed the html validation.
![screenshot of final html validator results](/documentation/html-val-index-2.webp)

##### HTML - [japan.html](japan.html)

![screenshot of html validator results for the japan page](/documentation/html-val-japan.webp)

The initial check highlighted a few issues with the code. These issues have now been addressed and all of the html code on the Japan result page has successfully passed the html validation.
![screenshot of final html validator results](/documentation/html-val-index-2.webp)

##### HTML - [kenya.html](kenya.html)

![screenshot of html validator results for the kenya page](/documentation/html-val-kenya.webp)

The initial check highlighted a few issues with the code. These issues have now been addressed and all of the html code on the Kenya result page has successfully passed the html validation.
![screenshot of final html validator results](/documentation/html-val-index-2.webp)

##### HTML - [barbados.html](barbados.html)

![screenshot of final html validator results](/documentation/html-val-index-2.webp)

The initial check did not highlight any issues with the code on the Barbados result page.

##### CSS Stylesheet

Please view this [link](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?lang=en&profile=css3svg&uri=https%3A%2F%2Fchandni-l5.github.io%2Fideal-destination%2F&usermedium=all&vextwarning=&warning=1) to see the results of the CSS validation which has passed checks. Although there are 2 warning messages shown no further action is required as these are related to shortfalls of certain browsers.

#### 6.6.2 Autoprefixer CSS

I have used [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.githib.io) to add vendor prefixes to the CSS.

#### 6.6.3 JS jshint

The JavaScript code has been validated through [Jshint](https://jshint.com/). Both script sheets have been checked and no amendment is required. The second script does identify an undefined variable however the confetti effect used on the result pages has been implemented through a JS library and so the variable defined is linked on the html page before the closing tag for `</body>` on the result html pages.
